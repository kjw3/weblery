{"name":"Weblery","tagline":"Simple PHP Photo Gallery formerly hosted on SourceForge","body":"![Weblery Logo](//i1.wp.com/www.kjw3.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/weblery_logo.jpg)\r\n\r\nweblery\r\n=======\r\n\r\nSimple PHP Photo Gallery formerly hosted on SourceForge\r\n\r\nProject Summary\r\n=======\r\n\r\nWeblery is a simple php based web photo gallery. It is driven by the directory structure of the gallery. All that is needed is to include the weblery.php file into your website.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by [KJW3, LLC](http://kjw3.com)\r\n\r\nv1.2.1 Released on GitHub\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFinally moving my projects over to GitHub. Weblery has been dutifully hosted on SourceForge since 2009. However, I'm trying to consolidate my projects in Git and will utilize GitHub as the public interface.\r\n\r\nWeblery 1.2 Released and Naked!\r\n=======\r\n\r\nWeblery now has the capability to display a single album naked (meaning no gallery listing and no thumbnails). This feature was added to allow Weblery's use in blog posts, on craigslist, ebay, or any where else that one could imagine wanting to display only one album.\r\n\r\nNote that as part of this release there was a significant change to how Weblery handles it's behind the scenes pathing and location. Prior to version 1.2, Weblery had a configuration parameter named confWebleryBasePath which had to be set in order to know the location of the weblery.php file. As of version 1.2, Weblery determines it's own location. Keep this in mind if you intend to upgrade. User's are welcome to try version 1.2, but please make a backup of your older Weblery Version first in case you encounter any issues.\r\n\r\nThe naked feature is a really welcome addition to an already simple photo gallery. The manual has a few examples of how to dynamically load a naked gallery. You can also force Weblery to load naked by simply adding naked=true as a url parameter.\r\n\r\nWeblery version 1.2 is now available from SourceForge. Please visit Weblery.com to download the latest version.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 Bug Fix\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI have released version 1.1 to resolve an issue with album initialization. In some environments, version 1.0 of Weblery would start the album initialization but never complete it. Version 1.1 should resolve this issue.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 Now Available\r\n=======\r\n\r\nWeblery Version 1.0 is now available for download. Some of the changes include: Album sort by latest updated, Stripped down layouts, Upgrade to JQuery, Improved performance, Corrections to PHP4 version, and More configuration options.\r\n\r\nAlpha Release Available\r\n=======\r\n\r\nWeblery's alpha release is now available for public use. It is version 0.3. Please go to the download page at http://www.weblery.com\r\n\r\nWeblery's anticipated alpha release\r\n=======\r\n\r\nWeblery's anticipated alpha release is currently scheduled for 6/17/2009. At that time, the first download will be available.\r\n","google":"UA-56836943-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
